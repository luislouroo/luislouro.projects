My name is Luis Louro and i'm currently starting my 5th and last year in mechanical engineering. I allways loved mechanics and the magic behind mechanical systems. During the last years i started to develop some projects related to mechanical engineering on my free tyme as hobby. This website is to show you the results and knowledge acquired doing it.
